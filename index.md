# UNIIQ Management API Documentation

Management API is organized around REST API's. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, can accepts both form-encoded request bodies/json payloads, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes (references) for status codes, JWT authentication, and verbs operations.

* UNIIQ Management Account with (Content Provider / Service Provider) access.
